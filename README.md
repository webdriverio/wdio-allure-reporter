WDIO Allure Reporter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webdriverio/wdio-allure-reporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/webdriverio/wdio-allure-reporter) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/webdriverio/wdio-allure-reporter/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/webdriverio/wdio-allure-reporter)
====================

> A WebdriverIO reporter plugin to create [Allure Test Reports](http://allure.qatools.ru/).

## Installation

The easiest way is to keep `wdio-allure-reporter` as a devDependency in your `package.json`.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "wdio-allure-reporter": "~0.1.2"
  }
}
```

You can simple do it by:

```bash
npm install wdio-allure-reporter --save-dev
```

Instructions on how to install `WebdriverIO` can be found [here](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/install.html).

## Configuration
Configure the output directory in your wdio.conf.js file:

```js
exports.config = {
    // ...
    reporters: ['allure'],
    reporterOptions: {
		allure: {
			outputDir: 'allure-results'
		}
	},
	// ...
}
```

`outputDir` defaults to `./allure-results`. After a test run is complete, you will find that this directory has been populated with an `.xml` file for each spec, plus a number of `.txt` and `.png` files and other attachments.

## Custom attachments

You can save custom attachments to tests/steps by calling `process.send` to `allure:attachment` within your hook:

```js
afterStep: function (step) {
    var serverLogs = getServerLogsSomehow();
    
    process.send({
        event: 'allure:attachment',
        test: step.getStep().getName(), // The name of the test to attach this to
        name: 'Server logs', // The name that this attachment should get in the report
        content: '<pre style="font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, ' +
            '\'Liberation Mono\', Menlo, Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px">' +
            serverLogs.replace(/\n/g, '<br>') + '</pre>',
        mimeType: 'text/html',
    });
}
```

Until [webdriverio/webdriverio#1893](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/pull/1893) lands, there is no certain way to connect your hook with the specific Allure report being assembled for that test run; for now, we check the current open Allure reports for the one that has the most recent test with the name you send here via the `test` property, and this attachment is added to that test. If by coincidence there are two in-progress Allure reports that both have a most-recent test with the same name, the attachment will only be added to the first one.

If you send HTML, Allure will display it as rich HTMLâ€”even with images, if you include an `img src` with a base64-encoded data URI. This is another way to include custom images in your output:

```js
afterStep: function (step) {
    var image = new Buffer(require('fs').readFileSync('download.png')).toString('base64');
    
    process.send({
        event: 'allure:attachment',
        test: step.getStep().getName(),
        name: 'Downloaded image',
        content: '<img src="data:image/png;base64,' + image + '">',
        mimeType: 'text/html',
    });
}
```

If you leave out `mimeType`, plain text is assumed. If you send `application/json`, the JSON will be pretty-printed with four spaces.

## Displaying the report
The results can be consumed by any of the [reporting tools](https://docs.qameta.io/allure#_reporting) offered by Allure. For example:

### Jenkins
Install the [Allure Jenkins plugin](https://docs.qameta.io/allure#_jenkins), and configure it to read from the correct directory:
![screenshot 2016-02-05 10.10.30.png](./docs/images/jenkins-config.png)

Jenkins will then offer a link to the results from the build status page:
![screenshot 2016-02-05 10.12.08.png](./docs/images/jenkins-results.png)

If you open a report at the first time you probably will notice that Jenkins won't serve the assets due to security restrictions. If that is the case go to Jenkins script console (`http://<your_jenkins_instance>/script`) and put in these security settings:

```
System.setProperty("hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';")
System.setProperty("jenkins.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';")
```

Apply and restart the Jenkins server. All assets should now be served correctly.

### Command-line
Install the [Allure command-line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/allure-commandline), and process the results directory:
```bash
allure generate [allure_output_dir] && allure open
```
This will generate a report (by default in `./allure-report`), and open it in your browser:

## Development

### Integration Tests
Integration Tests are running webdriverio multiple times using the wdio-allure-reporter and verifying the output.

Run http server to serve test pages:
```
./node_modules/.bin/static ./test/fixtures
```
Run tests:
```
npm test
```
